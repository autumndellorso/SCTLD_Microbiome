# SCTLD_Microbiome
Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida, conducted a SCTLD transmission experiment in 2021 on four species of stony coral including Porites asteroides, Acropora cervicornis, Montastraea cavernosa and Orbicella faveolata. Mote allocated 103 of these experimental corals to this study, where we sampled each one and examined them for their microbial community composition. The goal of this study was to analyze susceptible and non-susceptible corals to stony coral tissue loss disease and compare their microbiomes using a variety of R packages such as ANCOMBC2 and phyloseq.
